# lsml22
Notebooks for the [2022 course on Large Scale Machine Learning at Mines ParisTech](http://cazencott.info/index.php/pages/LSML-22-Large-Scale-Machine-Learning).

## Day 1: Introduction to large scale ML
* If you are familiar with `scikit-learn` (for example, Mines students who had Data Science in their first year or took "Apprentissage artificiel" previously), work on notebook `1_sklearn_at_scale.ipynb`.
* If you are not familiar with `scikit-learn`, you can start with [this notebook](https://github.com/chagaz/ml-notebooks/tree/master/intro-ml-genetics) to get a hang of things. 

## Day 2: Deep learning
TBA

## Day 3: Stochastic gradient descent
Work on notebook `3_stochastic_gradient_descent.ipynb`.

## Day 4: Deep reinforcement learing
TBA
